# Changelog

## [Stage 0] — Foundation & Architecture — 2026-08-31

Initial skeleton. No AI models — mock providers only.

### Added
- FastAPI backend with CRUD for singers, projects, songs, sections, lyric lines,
  and jobs; `/health` and OpenAPI docs at `/docs`.
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM + Alembic migration for all core entities: Singer, Project,
  Song, SongSection, LyricLine, VocalRole, VocalAssignment, BandReference,
  GenerationJob, AudioAsset.
- `LyricLine` entity and section/line vocal-role resolution
  (`sr/common/resolver.py`) — the per-line singer-assignment amendment.
- Job system: `JobQueue` abstraction with `eager` / `inline` / `rq` backends,
  shared `run_job` runner capturing seed, params, provider version, input asset
  ids, logs, error, attempts, timing, and output assets with lineage.
- Provider ABCs (music / voice / stem / analysis / mastering / transcription),
  mock implementations that emit real silent WAVs, and a config-driven registry.
- `sr/common/allocation.py` — deterministic largest-remainder allocation +
  percentage normalization (70/20/10 @ 10 → 7/2/1).
- `sr/common/seeds.py` — blake2b child-seed derivation + bounded jitter.
- `sr/common/storage.py` — local filesystem store with an S3-shaped interface.
- `sr/orchestrator/pipeline.py` — generation stage graph + dry-run planner.
- Next.js app: home/health, singers, songs, jobs pages talking to the API.
- Scripts: `setup.ps1`, `dev.ps1`, `worker.ps1`, `test.ps1`, `stage_gate.py`.
- Optional `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres + Redis + api + worker + web).
- Docs: README, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, MODEL_SETUP, DATASET_GUIDE, TEST_PLAN,
  DECISIONS, CHANGELOG.
- 29 automated tests (ruff clean).

### Stage 0 exit criteria — all PASS
- Stack boots locally · CRUD for singers/projects/songs · mock generation job
  queued → completed with lineage · test suite passes.
